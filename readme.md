What is it?
This is a simple single page weather application that uses data from a third party API to lay out a day by day forcast based on the city users input in the search bar.
The application can be seen in action here: http://fathomless-mesa-61290.herokuapp.com/index.htm#!/

Known Bugs:
Currently, the API that is called by the application is not compatible with HTTPS protocols, and thus the webpage must use HTTP if users wish to recive data.

Plans for future development?
Though at the moment I have no intent of continuing to develop this application, a few ideas for bug fixes and other features follow;
-HTTPS bug can be fixed by finding different third party API and reconfiguring code to pull data from it instead.
-SVG icons could be added to the forcast to represent different whether stats visually.
-Googles location services API could be called to set the initial location displayed in the search bar
